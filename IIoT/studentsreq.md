# Learning Students requirements for Smart Intelligence Factory

## Only for Learning

### IoT/AI

- How does student experiment Edge and cloud?
- How and what is needed to collect data and send to cloud (Basics)?
- What are some architecture students can use build IoT application for remote monitoring, Predictive maintenance, Anamoly detection?
- How can students works as team and build end to end IoT applications?
- How do Students use the IoT Carts and build IoT Applications?
- How do students use IoT Carts to build edge/cloud based quality detection or vision based inspection projects?
- How are data secured in the cloud?
- How can we do Big data analysis in case we need to process lots of data?
- How do we build Traceability applications for good produced?
- Given it's student environment we would like to have flexibility on connectiving different edge devices from other vendors or partners?


### Industrial IoT/AI

- How does OT/IT communication and security works?
- How does a system to system communication in OT works?
- How does a assembly line/station send data back to cloud?
- What components are needed to grab data for analytics?
- How can get students to work on anomaly detection?
- What would be a architecture students use for Predictive Maintenance from Assembly line?
- How can students Collect data from industrial systems with multiple SI/vendors and process and build Industrial IoT application in cloud?
- How can we integrate between different Manufacturing systems that are available real manufacturing (not Rasperry PI). Assembly lines are cumbersome since it's built by other vendors and they provide their own Industrial IoT solution?
- How are security handled in Industrial devices which may or may not be intelligent or have processing power?
- How do we built UI for station or use case in station or assembly line locally in the facility?
- we don't built circuit boards but have to purchase from vendors to build solution, in that scenario how are security handled? how is the data collected?
- Do we have any data model that we can use to accumulate desparate systems data into one common model?
- How do we integrate with business Systems like SAP for ERP, Sales Force (CRM) , MES or MOM and other systems to build a cohesive MFG application to increase productivity, reduce downtime and increase efficieny?
- How to we provide Historical data access in cloud (like query capability) to analyze trend, Find patterns and also do root cause analysis for situation where we don't have answers but we want to find answers?
- How do students use build and implement edge/cloud based quality detection or vision based inspection projects?
- How do students build digital twin for assembly line/station and process and see realtime/historical data overlay with prediction using MR/3D or 2D based methodology?
