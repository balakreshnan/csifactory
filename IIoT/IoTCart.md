# IoT Cart for Industrial IoT beginners

## Pre-requistie

- Need to know concepts of IoT
- Manufacturing Knowledge

## Internet of things

- What is IoT
- Internet of things is small computer connected to sensors
- For Students Computer boards will be different, sensors and bread board and wires
- Bread board is good to connect computer and sensors
- Some times computer like raspberry pi has GPIO pins to connect directly to sensors
- Some time that is not enough so bread board gives extensibility
