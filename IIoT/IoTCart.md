## Rasperry Pi

### Grove Pi Starter Kit

#### Grove - Temp&Humi Sensor

- Build Remote monitoring for Temperature and humidity - Realtime
    - Useful for Manufacturers where temperature sensitive manufacturing process
    - Use ful for process industry where humidity and temperature can affect the production process
    - Temperature and humidty can be indoor or outdoor
- Collect data to predict Temperature and 
- Like Painting (power coat)

#### Grove - Rotary Angle Sensor

- Build system to detect rotating angle and show real time charts
- Ability to predict how the angle is going change based on past experience
- Stability detection
- Moving inventory or product from point to point

#### Grove - Sound Sensor

- Ability to detect sound and record
- Ability to store sounds in cloud
- Vibration analysis using sound
- detect distruss signal from equipment
- detect distruss signal from workers
- detect argument or other sounds like gun shot, natural disaster, un identified objects
- Use the sound to predict
- Create voice based Line HMI
- Scada systems that can react to sound commands for authentication or perform operations
- provide Converstation AI user interface for HMI and Scada systems

#### Grove - LCD RGB Backlight/Light Sensor

- Detect low light and provide light intensity to avoid eye issues
- Detect light intensity and provide higher light for vision or camera to get better picture or image
- Use light to do scienctific process
- For Example for premature baby light source is used for growth
- For growing plant inside production facility to provide pure oxygen
- Control LCD brightness based on outside light using light sensor
- Build New display for Station, line, or industrial equipment

#### Grove Button, LED

- Create application to react to light or temperature sensor and use Red, green, blue LED to provide visual status
- Create emergency stop, Start of operation, reset button operation to line, station or production
- Detect anomaly and change light to indicate operator something is going on
- Alarm supervisor if any distress signals found by workers or accidents
- Alarm with colors for hardazous material spill or disaster

#### Grove Relay
- https://seeeddoc.github.io/Grove-Relay/
- https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Relay/
- Create how to control circuits, switches using relay
- Based on decision send signals to make changes
- control the current and provide safe environment for devices

#### Grove Ultrasonic Ranger
- Distance measurement device
- Can be used for proximity calculation
- If human come close stop the line or station for human safety
- https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Ultrasonic_Ranger/#:~:text=Grove%20-%20Ultrasonic%20Ranger%20-%20Seeed%20Wiki%20Grove,of%2040kHz%20cycle%20level%20and%20detect%20the%20echo.
